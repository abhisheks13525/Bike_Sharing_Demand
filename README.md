# Bike_Sharing_Demand
Used hourly rental data spanning two years for predicting the total count of bikes rented during each hour covered by the test set.

Applied L1 and L2 norm regularization over weight vectors, in order to find the best hyper-parameter settings using validation data. Evaluating accuracy on test data for no regularization, L1 norm regularization, and L2 norm regularization. 

Thus determining the most important feature for count of bikes rented
